# SafeKnife-Arduino
(Aug - Dec 2017) Project for the course "ING2030 - RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP" at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.

As a group we created a knife that prevents accidents in the kitchen. We aimed the product for professional chefs and for domestic use as well.

We studied the Chilean context and developed a prototype consisting of a custom made knife that uses an arduino plate. The board is connected to a color sensor that detects a hand using a glove of a certain color and if the hand intersects the path of the cut, the knife lock is released decreasing the power of the impact and preventing the cut.
